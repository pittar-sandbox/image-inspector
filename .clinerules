# Project Rules

1.  **Project Configuration**:
    *   This is a Python 3.12 project
    *   **IMPORTANT**: Do not change the version of Python.

2.  **Workflow**:
    *   **Git Branching**:
        *   Create a new git branch for each new "task".
        *   **Naming Convention**: Branch names must start with either `feature/` or `fix/` (e.g., `feature/new-login-page`, `fix/memory-leak`).
        *   **Descriptiveness**: The rest of the branch name must be descriptive of the task.
    *   **Testing**: All new functionality must have good unit tests. Verify that tests pass before marking a task as complete.
    *   **Task Planning**: All todos for a task should be kept track of in the `plan.md` file. Each new branch should start with a clean `plan.md` file.
    *   **Completion**: At the end of a task, ensure all updates have been committed to the feature branch.
